### Overview
Ereshtar is a thought experiment around decentralisation. The idea came about as a culmination of Mozretreat 2019. Over the course of the retreat there was a great deal of discussion around artificial intelligence since better machine decision making a big focus of Mozilla's for the coming years. In thinking of our space the idea of being enlighted around all the different things that involve AI was likened to taking a red pill in *The Matrix*, and weaving in further ideas about society and the world today this awakening was translated as grass roots activism rebelling against centralised authority and springtime. So was created Ereshtar, the Earth Spring, a time that is upon humanity when the old ways of Winter fall way and we come into our freedom and power, like flowers in spring time.

The four seasons, Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer have a deeper significance than you may realise. Humanity was created in the Summer, a time remembered as naught but myths and legends. The seasons quickly moved to Autumn as nomadic hunter gatherers settled down, centralised themselves, formed government and set about their petty conflicts. As these times moved to industrialisation the seasons moved to Winter. Humanity spread and conquered, millions dying in the process. 

But now, Winter has broken. Times are changing and the seasons are shifting. All around the world, events like the Arab Spring show that people are disaffected with their creation, government. Faith in government, and indeed all forms of centralised authority are at an all time low, with no sign of improvement. Hung parliaments are now the norm in democracies the world over. But people feel the change, the shift in power beneath their feet and yearn for a connection to community, to family and to one another, rather than chains to arbitrary forces that entrench differences and inequality.

There was a great excitement over blockchain as decentralised technology, but why treat the green shoot as the be all and end all when the mighty oak is yet to rise? As people come to realise the profound meaning of decentralisation in all its forms, the scales fall from peopleâ€™s eyes. Suddenly they see what has always been there, lying before them and waiting to be reclaimed.
The Winter has broken, the ice is melting, and its water feeds crops of unimaginable change. Welcome to the Ereshtar, the Earth Spring.
