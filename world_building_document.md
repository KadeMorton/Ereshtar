# World Building Document

## Introduction
The four seasons, Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer have a deeper significance than you may realise. Just has nature responds to seasons, there are seasons that guide a person’s life. This unexplainable power comes from the grand seasons, cosmic cycles that define worlds.

Humanity was created in the Summer, a time remembered as naught but myths and legends. The seasons quickly moved to Autumn as nomadic hunter gatherers settled down, centralised themselves, formed government and set about their petty conflicts. As these times moved to industrialisation the seasons moved to Winter. Humanity spread and conquered, millions dying in the process.  

But now, Winter has broken. Times are changing and the seasons are shifting. All around the world, events like the Arab Spring show that people are disaffected with their creation, government. Faith in government, and indeed all forms of centralised authority are at an all time low, with no sign of improvement. Hung parliaments are now the norm in democracies the world over. But people feel the change, the shift in power beneath their feet and yearn for a connection to community, to family and to one another, rather than chains to arbitrary forces that entrench differences and inequality.

There was a great excitement over blockchain as decentralised technology, but why treat the green shoot as the be all and end all when the mighty oak is yet to rise? As people come to realise the profound meaning of decentralisation in all its forms, the scales fall from people’s eyes. Suddenly they see what has always been there, lying before them and waiting to be reclaimed.

The Winter has broken, the ice is melting, and its water feeds crops of unimaginable change. Welcome to the Ereshtar, the Earth Spring.

## History
In the beginning there was the void of Basangup, and it was the First Winter. Creation began to unfold, and with its energy came the eternal dance of the seasons. The first things to come into being were the stars. Their life giving energy was a testimate to their place as the first born, and the increase of energy in the cosmos heralded the First Spring. Then came the planets, little more than lifeless rock and ice. But the stars, or suns, melted the ice of some planets to water, and so the preconditions of life were created. But the suns were scattered accross the cosmos, and had alredy existed for longer than they could reckon. Despite the fact that Basangup had been filled with all creation and winter had broken, they had no company as far apart as they were, and one cried in her lonliness. Ten tears of the sun fell to Earth and became the great beings of fire, the Cerextli. Filled with the energy and the depth of emotion of their mother, the life giving energy of the Cerextli infused everything around them. The mountains opened their mouths and spoke and the water grew legs and danced. The elementals tended to nature life took root everywhere. And something else miraculous happened.

Life, completely separate from the animation of the already existing elements, also sprang up. As the Cerextli drank, their enegry infused water and soon life sprung from the water. Soon there was single cell organisms, multicellular organisms, and then life crawled from the ocean. The Cerextli watched on, patient wardens of their children. They watched as species came and went until humanity arrived. Spring had now turned to Summer. The Cerextli taught humans how to forage and hunt. They taught them to cultivate and journeyed with the humans far and wide across Earth. It was a time of grand adventures and mighty deeds that would turn to legends. The cerexlti taught the humans the eternal cycle of the seasons and the value of community, which the Cerextli had been created for from the sun. All must be looked after in the community, all must have their voices heard, no one person or groups of people could dominate as this imbalance, to fall out of equinox with one another, would errode community as winter errodes the heat of Summer.

But tragedy struck. In the hubris of humanity they turned away from the teachings of the Cerextli. They formed nobility, casts, kings and queens, monarchs, chiefs and emperors. Knowing they had lost the hearts of humanity, at least for now, the Cerextli one by dormant, and with them the elementals. 

The Cerextli watched and waited, until

these beings were created, they sprouted life in the first summer, autumn and winter while developed, spring and then summer of man
from them fire came
they taught them how to live and grow crops
law flowed from them
man set aside their laws, autumn set in and they slowly went to sleep
they are seen in the and name a bunch of things from across the world

## The Cerextli
they go through a cycle where they shed their skin, which is where the fire came from, it extinguishes to be a seed husk, when they grow and then burst into fire again.
the process their culture, alws coming from them

##  The Elementals

## The Chototec
seeds, germination, equinox, ideas, lead nto the world of today
great bonfire, seeds

## the effect on the world today
the power of summer was scattered and we've started to put the pieces back together
## not yet worked in 
time, lunar and solar
afterlife, eternal travelling amongst the stars
